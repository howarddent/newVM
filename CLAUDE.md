# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Free Pascal / Lazarus library (`newVM`) providing matrix/vector objects that
wrap Intel MKL (BLAS/LAPACK/VSL) and Intel IPP for linear algebra. It is
explicitly inspired by the Dew MtxVec library for FPC, but — unlike Dew —
does not distinguish matrix and vector types: a vector is just an (N,1) or
(1,N) matrix. There are four parallel "flavors" of the same object model for
real/complex × double/single precision (see Architecture below).

There is no README, no test framework config beyond FPCUnit's `TestRegistry`
being pulled in, and no CI. `newVMtest.lpr` is a scratch/smoke-test program,
not a real unit test suite.

## Build

Building requires:
- Lazarus + FPC (this repo was built against Lazarus at `~/Lazarus`; `lazbuild`
  needs `--lazarusdir=<path>` and a working `fpc`/`ppcx64` on `PATH`).
- Intel oneAPI MKL runtime (`libmkl_rt.so`) and IPP runtime (`libippcore.so`,
  `libippvm.so`, `libipps.so`) discoverable at link/run time — these are
  `dlopen`'d at runtime, not statically linked, so they must also be on
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or equivalent) when *running* the built binary, not just
  when compiling.
- OpenBLAS (`libopenblas`) — `cblas.pas` binds against it directly for the
  `CBLAS_ORDER`/`CBLAS_TRANSPOSE`/etc. enum types and some declarations, even
  though the actual matrix math at runtime comes from MKL.

Build the test program:
```
lazbuild --lazarusdir=/home/howard/Lazarus newVMtest.lpi
```
Compiled output goes to `lib/x86_64-linux/` (units) and `newVMtest` (binary),
per the `UnitOutputDirectory` in the `.lpi`.

Run it:
```
./newVMtest
```
(No CLI args are meaningfully handled beyond `-h`/`--help`.)

There is no headless `fpc`-only build path documented here — always build via
`lazbuild` and the `.lpi`, since that's what encodes the search paths and
compiler options (assertions are force-enabled via
`IncludeAssertionCode=True`, which several routines rely on for argument
validation — see below).

## Architecture

### The four parallel unit families

The same object model is duplicated four times, once per real/complex ×
double/single combination — there is no shared generic base:

| Unit | Element type | Object type | MKL prefix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `newVM.pas` | `Double` | `TVMobj` | `d` (e.g. `cblas_dgemm`) |
| `newVMSingle.pas` | `Single` | `TVMobjS` | `s` |
| `newVMComplex.pas` | `TComplex16` (double re/im) | `TVMobjZ` | `z` |
| `newVMComplexSingle.pas` | `TComplex8` (single re/im) | `TVMobjC` | `c` |

When fixing a bug or adding an operation in one of these, check whether the
same fix is needed in the sibling units — they are hand-copied, not
generated, so they drift independently unless kept in sync deliberately.

Complex units `uses` their same-precision real sibling (`newVMComplex`
depends on `newVM`, `newVMComplexSingle` depends on `newVMSingle`) to support
real→complex promotion (`RealToComplex`) and part extraction
(`GetRealPart`/`GetImagPart`/`SplitComplex`).

### Core object shape (`TVMobj` and siblings)

Each is a Pascal `record` (not a `class`) wrapping a dynamic array (`fData`)
plus `frows`/`fcols`. Elements are stored **row-major**, and addressed via
the default indexed property `Element[r,c]`, backed by `calcoffset` — note
`calcoffset` computes `(r*(c-1))+r-1`, which is *not* the standard
`r*cols+c` row-major formula; read it carefully before assuming standard
indexing when touching offset logic (`writeMatrix` and the complex-unit
`fillRandom`/copy tricks use `i*cols+j` directly instead, which is the
formula you'd normally expect — the two coexist in the codebase).

Because these are records, not classes, **value semantics apply**: assigning
one `TVMobj` to another copies the record header but `fData` is a dynamic
array, so plain assignment aliases the underlying buffer. Use `CopyObj`
(`CopyObjZ`/etc. in the other units) when an independent copy is required —
several routines (e.g. `EigDecompose`) do this deliberately because the
underlying LAPACK call overwrites its input matrix in place.

All bounds/shape checks are done via `assert(...)` with a descriptive
message, not exceptions — they only fire because the `.lpi` enables
`IncludeAssertionCode`. Follow this pattern (guard clause + `assert`, with a
unit-local `const s = 'Routine Name : '` prefix on the message) rather than
introducing exception-based validation.

`DataPtr` (on `TVMobj`) and the equivalent raw-pointer access on the other
records exist specifically so sibling units can hand a raw buffer pointer
straight into an MKL call without needing friend/private access — this is
the established pattern for cross-unit interop; use it rather than exposing
more internal fields.

### Operator overloads

Each of the four units declares `+`, `-` (binary and unary), `*`, and `/`
for its `TVMobj*` type as **`class operator` members of the record**
(e.g. `class operator +(const A, B: TVMobj): TVMobj;` inside `TVMobj`,
implemented as `class operator TVMobj.+(const A, B: TVMobj): TVMobj;`).
This is required, not stylistic: all four units compile under `{$mode
Delphi}`, and Delphi mode only recognises operator overloading declared
as `class operator` inside the type — the free-standing "`operator + (a,
b: T): T;`" form declared at unit scope (as seen in plenty of `{$mode
ObjFPC}` code elsewhere, e.g. `components/tachart/tageometry.pas` in the
Lazarus source tree) is an ObjFPC/FPC-mode-only extension and gets
rejected under Delphi mode with a parser error that reads "IMPLEMENTATION
expected but OPERATOR found" (because the parser doesn't treat `operator`
as a declaration keyword there at all under this mode). Like a normal
function, the implementation body uses the implicit `Result` variable —
there is no named custom result identifier in FPC's operator syntax,
class or global. Declaration (inside the record) and implementation
(qualified `TypeName.symbol`) signatures must match exactly.

The two complex units' *mixed* real/complex operators (e.g. `TVMobjZ +
TVMobj`) are declared as `class operator` members of the complex type
(`TVMobjZ`/`TVMobjC`), never the real type — Delphi's rule is that a
`class operator` must be a member of one of its operand types, and since
only the complex unit `uses` the real sibling unit, `TVMobjZ`/`TVMobjC`
is the only one of the two records that can see both types at the point
of declaration.

What backs each operator, and why:
- `+`/`-` are element-wise, via `cblas_?axpy` (`Y := alpha*X + Y`, with
  alpha = ±1) applied on top of a `CopyObj`-produced scratch buffer, not a
  hand-rolled loop.
- unary `-` negates via `cblas_?scal` (real units) or `cblas_?dscal`/
  `cblas_?sscal` (complex units — MKL's "scale a complex vector by a real
  scalar" routine, used here with -1).
- `*` between two same-type `TVMobj*` is matrix multiplication; it just
  delegates to the existing `MatMult`/`MatMultS`/`MatMultZ`/`MatMultC`
  rather than duplicating the `cblas_?gemm` call.
- `*`/`/` against a scalar scale every element via `cblas_?scal`. The real
  units' `/` uses IPP's `ippsDivC_64f_I`/`ippsDivC_32f_I` directly (division
  by a constant is a native IPP primitive); the complex units' `/` instead
  computes the scalar reciprocal in Pascal and calls `cblas_?scal`, since
  BLAS has no "divide vector by scalar" routine. The complex units accept
  *either* their native complex scalar (`TComplex16`/`TComplex8`, via
  `cblas_zscal`/`cblas_cscal`) *or* a plain real scalar (`Double`/`Single`,
  via `cblas_zdscal`/`cblas_csscal`) for `*` and `/` — two overloads
  distinguished by the scalar's type, so both `Z * Cplx(1,2)` and `Z * 2.0`
  work without an explicit cast.
- `newVMComplex.pas`/`newVMComplexSingle.pas` additionally overload `+`,
  `-`, `*` for mixed complex/real operands (`TVMobjZ` with `TVMobj`,
  `TVMobjC` with `TVMobjS`, both operand orders) by promoting the real
  operand via `RealToComplex`/`RealToComplexS` and delegating to the
  same-type complex operator — these can only live in the complex units
  since only they `uses` the real sibling unit.

### Elementwise math functions

Each unit also declares plain (non-operator) functions `Sin`, `Cos`, `Tan`,
`Sinh`, `Sqr`, `Sqrt`, `Exp`, `Ln` — each takes a `TVMobj*` and returns a
new one of the same dimensions with the function applied to every element.
Backed by MKL VML's plain `vd*`/`vs*`/`vc*`/`vz*` entry points (declared in
`OneAPI.pas` right after the pre-existing `vmd*` block — deliberately a
*different* function family, see the comment there: the `vmd*`/`vms*`/
`vmc*`/`vmz*` names take an extra trailing VML-mode argument that those
existing bindings don't pass, so don't extend that block by analogy;
extend the `vd*`/`vs*`/`vc*`/`vz*` block instead).

These are declared `overload` in every unit, which is load-bearing, not
decorative: without it, each unit's `Sin`/`Cos`/etc. would simply *hide*
`System`/`Math`'s versions (and each other's, across units) rather than
extending them, since plain identifier redeclaration in Pascal shadows by
default. `overload` is what lets `newVMtest.lpr` — which `uses` all four
`TVMobj*` units together — call `Sin(dblA)`, `Sin(sngA)`, `Sin(cplA)`,
`Sin(cplsA)` and have each resolve to the right unit's version purely by
argument type, with the plain-numeric `Sin` still reachable too.

Complex `Sqrt`/`Ln` return principal-branch values (standard for MKL VML);
there's no attempt to unwrap branch cuts.

### External bindings

- `cblas.pas` — machine-generated (`h2pas`) BLAS declarations bound against
  OpenBLAS, providing `CBLAS_ORDER`, `CBLAS_TRANSPOSE`, etc. and base
  `cblas_*` function pointers/types.
- `OneAPI.pas` — hand-written bindings for LAPACKE (`lapacke_*`), Intel VML
  (`vmd*`), Intel IPP (`ipps*`), MKL memory management (`MKL_malloc` etc.),
  and MKL's VSL RNG (`vslNewStream`/`vdRngGaussian`/`vsRngGaussian`), plus the
  `TComplex16`/`TComplex8` record layouts (must stay bit-identical to
  `MKL_Complex16`/`MKL_Complex8` — two contiguous IEEE-754 floats — since
  several routines reinterpret a complex buffer as a flat real array via
  pointer casts, e.g. `fillRandom` and `RealToComplex`/`GetRealPart`).
- All four `newVM*` units declare `{$Linklib 'mkl_rt.so'}` plus `pthread`,
  `m`, and `dl` — the comment in each file header explains why: `mkl_rt.so`
  `dlopen`s `libmkl_core.so` at runtime, which expects `libm`/`pthread`/`dl`
  already resolved in the process's global symbol table, or you get
  `symbol lookup error: ... undefined symbol: log10`-style failures. Don't
  remove these linklib directives even though nothing in the unit calls into
  them directly.

### CBLAS/LAPACKE calling convention gotchas (complex units)

When touching `newVMComplex.pas`/`newVMComplexSingle.pas`:
- `cblas_zgemm`/`cblas_cgemm` take `alpha`/`beta` **by pointer**
  (`@alpha`/`@beta`), per the CBLAS C convention for complex scalars — unlike
  the real `dgemm`/`sgemm`, which take them by value.
- `lapacke_zlaset`/`lapacke_claset` take alpha/beta **by value** as complex
  scalars, matching the LAPACKE C signature.
- MKL's VSL has no complex Gaussian generator, so `fillRandom` on the complex
  types reinterprets the complex buffer as a real array of twice the length
  and calls the real generator once (valid only because the complex record
  layout is exactly two contiguous reals).

### Row-major matrix layout throughout

Every LAPACKE/CBLAS call passes `CBlasRowMajor` explicitly — this codebase
consistently uses row-major storage, unlike Fortran-native
column-major LAPACK. Keep new routines consistent with this.

### `newVMtest.lpr`

Smoke-test / demo program exercising: real→complex promotion
(`RealToComplexS`), identity fill (`.id`), matrix multiply (`matmultC`),
linear solve (`LinearSolveC`), and eigendecomposition (`EigDecomposeS`),
timed with `hirestimer.THighResTimer`. It's a manual sanity check you run
and eyeball the output of, not an automated pass/fail test — there's no
assertion-based test harness wired up despite `TestRegistry` being in the
`uses` clauses of the `newVM*` units.

Note: `newVMtest.lpi` lists `newvmconvert.pas` (unit `newVMConvert`) as a
project file, but that file does not currently exist in the repo — check
before assuming it's present when the `.lpi` is the source of truth for
project membership.

### `hirestimer.pas`

Platform-specific high-resolution timer (`THighResTimer`), using
`clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...)` on Unix. Used for timing MKL routine
calls in the test program.

### `backup/`

Contains earlier revisions of `newVM.pas`/`newVMComplex.pas` and an older
test project. Treat as historical reference only, not live code — the
current top-level `.pas` files are the ones actually built by `newVMtest.lpi`.
